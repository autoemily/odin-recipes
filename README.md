the current project is to create an HTML based recipe website
the skills used will be everything from the previous chapter


its been about an hour and im sure thats apparent in the actual content but hey, thats not really something this project is for right

the main difficulty i had with this project was git side, i think i may have installed it incorrectly, but in the end i was able to get it to push onto github 

still waiting for the thing to publish as a viewable site as i type this, but hey, I think i did a good job
